Group project for a college class on Game Programming with AI. 
Created a high-score game with Unity where the player, an alien, breaks into government facilities to collect as much data as possible while trying to avoid getting caught by the enemy AI.
Designed and implemented the gameâ€™s navigation mesh and enemy AI behaviors (patrol, chase, and attack).
Led the team as Project Manager, managing the project timeline, organizing regular meetings, and ensuring alignment with course requirements and deadlines.

BUGS:
  - Enemy AI collider and door collider not working right, so enemies walk through doors instead of opening them.
