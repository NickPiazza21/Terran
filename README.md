Group project for a college class on Game Programming with AI. My group and I created a high-score game with Unity where the player, an alien, breaks into government facilities to collect as much data as possible while trying to avoid getting caught by the enemy AI. I designed and implemented the gameâ€™s navigation mesh and enemy AI behaviors (patrol, chase, and attack). I also led the team as Project Manager, managing the project timeline, organizing regular meetings, and ensuring alignment with course requirements and deadlines.

The biggest challenge I faced in this project was not the technical work of developing the game, but the difficulty in coordinating with the team. There were many times where group members would be unresponsive to messages, announcements, or updates and would finish their tasks past the original due dates that we agreed on. Every time I tried to discuss these issues with my teammates, they would agree to do better but just continued the same behavior. The only time my group started to collaborate well would be the weekend before assignments were due. We would pull off 48-hour game jam style sessions, and everyone would be working together with perfect chemistry which was amazing, but it was disappointing to know that my team would not collaborate the same outside of those time periods. I would spend hours trying to come up with any solutions such as reducing the project size (Cutting back on game mechanics, assets, story, etc.), modifying due dates, or changing tasks for people, but all of that effort proved to be futile if my group was unresponsive, which is what made me realize how crucial team collaboration can be.

**BUGS:**
  - Enemy AI collider and door collider not working right, so enemies walk through doors instead of opening them.
  - Enemy AI animation is not configured correctly, so the animations look wonky.
