Group project for a college class on Game Programming with AI. My group and I created a high-score game with Unity where the player, an alien, breaks into government facilities to collect as much data as possible while trying to avoid getting caught by the enemy AI. I designed and implemented the game’s navigation mesh and enemy AI behaviors (patrol, chase, and attack). I also led the team as Project Manager, managing the project timeline, organizing regular meetings, and ensuring alignment with course requirements and deadlines.

**BUGS:**
  - Enemy AI collider and door collider not working right, so enemies walk through doors instead of opening them.
  - Enemy AI animation is not configured correctly, so the animations look wonky.
